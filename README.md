# Algorithms
This repository contains the following algorithms: 

1) Kadane's Algorithm - finding max subarray sum in O(n) time 
2) Comparison Sort Algorithms:
	a) Bubble Sort:
		- Space Complexity = O(1)
		- Best case Time Complexity = O(n)
		- Average case Time Complexity = O(n2)
		- Worst case Time Complexity = O(n2)
	b) Insertion Sort:
		- Space Complexity = O(1)
		- Best case Time Complexity = O(n)
		- Average case Time Complexity = O(n2)
		- Worst case Time Complexity = O(n2)
	c) Selection Sort:
		- Space Complexity = O(1)
		- Best case Time Complexity = O(n2)
		- Average case Time Complexity = O(n2)
		- Worst case Time Complexity = O(n2)
	d) Merge Sort:
		- Space Complexity = O(n)
		- Best case Time Complexity = O(n logn)
